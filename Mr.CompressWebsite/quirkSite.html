        <em>Quick explanation:
         This quirk grants its user to shrink down anything inside a spherical area into a small marble
        <br>without actually damaging it. Compress will affect anything that is found within a specific
        <br> range of space around the intended target, including, for example, fire or pieces of the ground.
    </h2> 

    <h2 class="text2">
        <em>Abilities:</em> 
        This quirk is a very straight forward quirk with no super moves.
        <br>It can dig trough solid objects by compressing a specific area from the solid object.
        <br>The user can compress themselves into a marble in a spherical area, 
        <br>as well as coming out of it again at free will.
        <br>When the user touches the target it wants to compress, it gets compressed into 
        <br>a small marble,no matter how heavy it was before, it becomes the weight of a simple marble.
    </h2>

    <h2 class="text3">
        <em>Weakness: </em>
        The quirk relies entirely within the users arms, meaning if the user would loose both of their arms , 
        <br>the user would loose this quirk.
        <br>It is not possible that the quirk would spread to any objects nearby, meaning that the user cant
        <br>just touch the ground and all the things touching the ground would also be compressed, which puts
        <br>the user at a huge disadvantage when it comes to long-range fights.
        <br>The user can not compress very large objects, the limit being probatly just roughly bigger than 
        <br>a person, since Mr.Compress never showed to compress something bigger than that.
